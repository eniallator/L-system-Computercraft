- Comments will have "--" in front of them that will tell the interpreter that it's a comment and not part of the algorithm
- Order of the instructions doesn't matter, as long as 1 of: start_string, rule, and function is present
- Error messages should be intuitive and easily understood
-
- List of functions that characters can be:
-
- rotate: parameter in degrees and is from -180 to 180
- forward: parameter distance forward in blocks
- forwardNoPlace: same as forward function but does not place blocks above the turtle
- save: save the current rotation/position
- load: loads the last rotation/position

----------- TEMPLATE -----------

start_string "*insert initial starting string here*"

rule "*insert character to look for here*" -> "*insert output characters here*"
-- line above can be repeated as many times as you like

function "*insert character here*" *insert function name here*()
-- you can also have multiple functions assigned to a character if you wrap them in {}
-- for example: 'function "a" {forward(2) rotate(90) forward(1)}'
